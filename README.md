## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-pokemon-card
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### API Configuration

To use real Pokemon TCG API data:

1. Get an API key from [Pokemon TCG Developer Portal](https://dev.pokemontcg.io/)
2. Update the `API_KEY` constant in `src/services/pokemonApi.ts`
3. Uncomment the API calls in `src/App.tsx`

Currently, the app uses mock data for development purposes.

## Mock Data System

The application includes a comprehensive mock data system for development and testing purposes. This allows you to work with realistic Pokemon card data without requiring an API key.

### Included Mock Data

#### Pokemon Cards

- **7 Pokemon cards** with complete data including:
  - Basic card information (name, HP, types, attacks, etc.)
  - Set information (series, release date, legalities)
  - Pricing data from TCGPlayer and Cardmarket
  - Images and artwork details
  - Rarity and collector information

#### Sets

- **25+ Pokemon card sets** including:
  - **Base Series**: Base Set, Jungle, Fossil, Base Set 2, Team Rocket
  - **Gym Series**: Gym Heroes, Gym Challenge
  - **Neo Series**: Neo Genesis, Neo Discovery, Neo Revelation, Neo Destiny
  - **E-Card Series**: Expedition Base Set, Aquapolis, Skyridge
  - **EX Series**: Ruby & Sapphire through Power Keepers (16 sets)
  - **Diamond & Pearl Series**: Diamond & Pearl through Stormfront (7 sets)
  - **Platinum Series**: Platinum through Arceus (4 sets)
  - **HeartGold & SoulSilver Series**: HeartGold & SoulSilver through Call of Legends (5 sets)

#### Types & Rarities

- **11 Pokemon types**: Colorless, Darkness, Dragon, Fairy, Fighting, Fire, Grass, Lightning, Metal, Psychic, Water
- **35 Rarities**: Including Common, Uncommon, Rare, Rare Holo, Rare Holo GX, Rare Holo V, Rare Holo VMAX, Rare Holo VSTAR, Rare Secret, Ultra Rare, Hyper Rare, Illustration Rare, Special Illustration Rare, and many more special rarities from different Pokemon TCG eras

### Using Mock Data

The mock data system is controlled by the `USE_MOCK_DATA` flag in `src/services/pokemonApi.ts`:

```typescript
const USE_MOCK_DATA = true; // Set to false to use real API
```

When enabled, the API service will:

- Return mock data instead of making real API calls
- Simulate network delays (300-500ms) for realistic behavior
- Support all filtering and pagination features
- Maintain the same data structure as the real API

### Mock Data Features

- **Realistic data structure** matching the Pokemon TCG API
- **Complete card information** with all required fields
- **Proper TypeScript types** for type safety
- **Filtering support** for name, type, rarity, and set
- **Pagination support** with proper page counts
- **Price data** from multiple sources (TCGPlayer, Cardmarket)

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## API Integration

The application integrates with the [Pokemon TCG API](https://pokemontcg.io/) to fetch:

- **Cards** - Pokemon card data with prices and details
- **Sets** - Available card sets for filtering
- **Types** - Pokemon types for filtering
- **Rarities** - Card rarities for filtering

### API Endpoints Used

- `GET /cards` - Fetch cards with pagination and filters
